It is located at the confluence of the Sava\r\n            and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the\r\n            Balkan Peninsula. It lies at the convergence of three historically\r\n            important routes of travel between Europe and the Balkans:{\" \"}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              east-west route along the Danube River valley from Vienna to the\r\n              Black Sea;\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              westward route along the valley of the Sava River toward Trieste\r\n              and northern Italy;\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              southeast route along the valleys of the Morava and Vardar rivers\r\n              to the Aegean Sea.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The urban area of Belgrade has a population of 1.23 million, while\r\n            nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of\r\n            the City of Belgrade. It is the seat of the central government,\r\n            administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of\r\n            almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific\r\n            institutions.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Brief history of the city</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Belgrade is one of the oldest cities in Europe. The area around\r\n            Belgrade was inhabited in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras,\r\n            while one of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the\r\n            Vinča culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th\r\n            millennium BC.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Τhe city was founded by the Celts in the 4thcentury BCE and it was\r\n            known as Singidunum by the Romans. Due to its location, Singidunum\r\n            became an important crossroad for the Roman provinces of Moesia,\r\n            Dacia, Pannonia and Dalmatia. This city of very tumultuous history\r\n            changed hands among the Sarmatians, Goths, and Gepidae.{\" \"}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It was later held by the Franks and the Bulgars, and in the 11th\r\n            century became a frontier town of Byzantium. In the 13th century it\r\n            came under the Serbian rule, and in 1402 despot Stefan Lazarević\r\n            made it the capital of Serbia. The Ottoman Turks besieged the city\r\n            in 1440, and until the 19th century it was in their hands.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            During the Turkish period Belgrade was a significant commercial\r\n            centre where goods were traded from various parts of the Ottoman\r\n            Empire. It came under Serbian rule in 1867 and once again became the\r\n            capital of Serbia.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After the World War I Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom\r\n            of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in\r\n            1929. During the period after the World War II, Belgrade grew\r\n            rapidly as the capital and the largest city of Yugoslavia\r\n            (1918-2003), developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, the\r\n            construction of New Belgrade started and in 1958, Belgrade's first\r\n            television station began broadcasting. Today, this modern European\r\n            city attracts tourists from all over the world, offering them a\r\n            unique experience.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>Sources of information:</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"http://www.beograd.rs/cir/beoinfo/201024-history/\"\r\n              >\r\n                http://www.beograd.rs/cir/beoinfo/201024-history/\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"http://www.serbia.com/visit-serbia/cities/belgrade/\"\r\n              >\r\n                http://www.serbia.com/visit-serbia/cities/belgrade/\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade\"\r\n              >\r\n                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Belgrade\"\r\n              >\r\n                https://www.britannica.com/place/Belgrade\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p></p>\r\n          <p></p>\r\n          <h2>The University of Belgrade</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The University of Belgrade is the oldest and largest university in\r\n            Serbia, and one of the most important educational and research\r\n            centers in Europe.

The\r\n            Serbian traditional food involves a lot of grilled meat, legumes and\r\n            many cabbage-based meals. It is a rich cuisine with a wide range of\r\n            alcohol beverages that accompany these fat-rich dishes. Most Serbian\r\n            restaurants serve the national cuisine, but there are lots of\r\n            international restaurants with a large variety of dishes (Chinese,\r\n            Italian, Japanese, French, Greek and Mexican).\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            We recommend visiting the picturesque neighborhood ‘Skadarlija’,\r\n            where you can find many traditional restaurants.

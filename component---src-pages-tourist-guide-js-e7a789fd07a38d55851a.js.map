The area around\r\n            Belgrade was inhabited in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras,\r\n            while one of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the\r\n            Vinča culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6\r\n            <sup>th</sup>\r\n            millennium BC.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Τhe city was founded by the Celts in the 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE\r\n            and it was known as Singidunum by the Romans. Due to its location,\r\n            Singidunum became an important crossroad for the Roman provinces of\r\n            Moesia, Dacia, Pannonia and Dalmatia. This city of very tumultuous\r\n            history changed hands among the Sarmatians, Goths, and Gepidae.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It was later held by the Franks and the Bulgars, and in the 11\r\n            <sup>th </sup>\r\n            century became a frontier town of Byzantium. In the 13<sup>\r\n              th\r\n            </sup>{\" \"}\r\n            century it came under the Serbian rule, and in 1402 despot Stefan\r\n            Lazarević made it the capital of Serbia. The Ottoman Turks besieged\r\n            the city in 1440, and until the 19<sup>th</sup> century it was in\r\n            their hands.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            During the Turkish period Belgrade was a significant commercial\r\n            centre where goods were traded from various parts of the Ottoman\r\n            Empire. It came under Serbian rule in 1867 and once again became the\r\n            capital of Serbia.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After the World War I, Belgrade became the capital of the new\r\n            Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of\r\n            Yugoslavia in 1929. During the period after the World War II,\r\n            Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital and the largest city of\r\n            Yugoslavia (1918-2003), developing as a major industrial centre. In\r\n            1948, the construction of New Belgrade started and in 1958,\r\n            Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. Today, this\r\n            modern European city attracts tourists from all over the world,\r\n            offering them a unique experience.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>Sources of information:</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"http://www.beograd.rs/cir/beoinfo/201024-history/\"\r\n              >\r\n                http://www.beograd.rs/cir/beoinfo/201024-history/\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"http://www.serbia.com/visit-serbia/cities/belgrade/\"\r\n              >\r\n                http://www.serbia.com/visit-serbia/cities/belgrade/\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade\"\r\n              >\r\n                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Belgrade\"\r\n              >\r\n                https://www.britannica.com/place/Belgrade\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p></p>\r\n          <p></p>\r\n          <h2>The University of Belgrade</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The University of Belgrade is the oldest and largest university in\r\n            Serbia, and one of the most important educational and research\r\n            centers in Europe. It was founded in 1808 as the Belgrade Higher\r\n            School in revolutionary Serbia and by 1838 it merged with other\r\n            Department in Kragujevac into a single university. Nowadays, the\r\n            University of Belgrade has around 97,700 enrolled students and over\r\n            4,800 academic members. The University comprises 31 departments, 12\r\n            research institutes, the university library, and 9 university\r\n            centers. The faculties are organized into 4 groups: Social Sciences\r\n            and Humanities, Medical Sciences, Natural Sciences and Mathematics,\r\n            and Technological Sciences.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h2>The Faculty of Philology</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The Faculty of Philology immerses its students in the academic study\r\n            and research of various domains in linguistics and philology, in\r\n            general. Since 1873, young people, having attended the Lyceum, have\r\n            the opportunity to continue the tertiary education tradition,\r\n            crossing over into University. Following this tradition, the Faculty\r\n            of Philology has been developing philological disciplines. It has\r\n            been growing as an autonomous Faculty since 1960. Nowadays, the\r\n            Faculty is divided into multiple departments (of different\r\n            linguistic and literary studies) equipped with their own libraries\r\n            and teaching over 30 languages. Moreover, it runs several research\r\n            centers and publishes a large number of periodical publications. The\r\n            Faculty is renowned for the publication of significant scientific\r\n            papers and the organization of cultural events.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <hr />\r\n          <p>\r\n            For more information visit:{\" \"}\r\n            <a\r\n              target=\"_blank\"\r\n              rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n              href=\"http://new.fil.bg.ac.rs/lang/sr/fakultet/o-fakultetu/\"\r\n            >\r\n              http://new.fil.bg.ac.rs/lang/sr/fakultet/o-fakultetu/\r\n            </a>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nexport default TouristGuide\r\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"content\":\"index-module--content--N6ZRp\",\"restaurants\":\"index-module--restaurants--1Qsqj\",\"paddingTop\":\"index-module--paddingTop--24J9m\",\"map\":\"index-module--map--TPV-E\",\"carriers\":\"index-module--carriers--CwHLh\",\"distances\":\"index-module--distances--18mAN\",\"taxi\":\"index-module--taxi--xaOlR\",\"disclaimer\":\"index-module--disclaimer--1THv7\",\"table\":\"index-module--table--1F46v\"};"],"sourceRoot":""}
